<p>
    If you are a React developer, and unless you have been living under a rock for the past year, 
    you will be familiar with Context, Reducers, and Hooks. Sure, these are generally simply called 
    "Hooks" or "custom hooks". Hooks gives the developer two advantages over the old-school method
    of build class-based components. These are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abliity to build an entire application using function components, and</li>
    <li>Elimination of the need for Redux.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Functional components make the code more concise and readible. They also provide a fairly significant 
    performance boost over classes. As for Redux. Well. Good riddance.
</p>
<p>
    Armed with hooks I decided that my next Reeact project would be written entirely with functions and 
    hooks. And this approach worked great until I needed to wire up Firebase Authentication. I discovered
    that the tutorials available all gave examples using class-based components. This article then, is my
    attempt to fill that gap with my notes on using Hooks with Firebase Authentication.
</p>
<p>
    Here are the things I had to build.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A "context" with a "context provider",</li>
    <li>A "reducer" (yeah, that's a dumb name),</li>
    <li>A custom hook that uses an Effect hook,</li>
    <li>Helper functions to interact with Firebase, and</li>
    <li>All the JSX to make it work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Reducer</h2>
<p>
    Let's start by writing a Reducer. That might seem a bit backward as I typically begin with my Context.
    But since the Reducer is referenced by the Context, I'll start with the Reducer. The reducer is used
    to make changes to the state of the properties managed by the Conext. If all this sounds like jargon
    (which it is), then I suggest reading up on React Hooks; especially useContext, useReducer, and
    useEffect. I'd love to explain all that here, but well, this article will be very long as it is.
</p>
<p>
    The Reducer and the Context will be supporting Firebase Authentication. I should mention here that
    I am using the Authentication SDK and not the drop-in UI. I should also mention that I am only 
    describing email based authentication. The properties of a "user" in
    Firebase are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>, which is the "display name" of the user. The display name is typically the user's full name.</li>
    <li><b>Email</b>, or the email address the user is treating as her id.</li>
    <li><b>PhotoURL</b>, a URL to an image the user has unloaded for their avatar.</li>
    <li><b>EmailVerified</b>, a boolean value that indicates the user responded to a verification message.</li>
    <li><b>Uid</b>, which is a global unique identifier assigned by Firebase to the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Reducers generally contain logic for adding, removing, or manipulating the Context's data. In this case
    though, the user data is managed by Firebase via its' SDK. All our reducer need to do it assure that the 
    context is current. I created a file named <i>SessionReducer.js</i> and included the code below.
</p>
<pre>
    export const SessionReducer = (state, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
          case "UPDATE":
            return {
              name: action.session.name,
              email: action.session.email,
              photourl: action.session.photourl,
              emailVerified: action.session.emailVerified,
              uid: action.session.uid
            };
          default:
            return state;
        }
      };
</pre>
<p>
    The <i>action.type</i> property is part of the Reducer specification. So the Reducer is passed the state
    and an action object and returns the new value of the state. In this case, we will only take one action
    that I have set to "UPDATE". The value <i>UPDATE</i>, by-the-way, is a discrensionary name set by the 
    developer. Also note that I do not need any import statements here.
</p>
<h2>The Context</h2>
<p>
    There are more parts to the Context. I'll show the code and then describe it. I created a file named <i>SessionContext.js</i> and included the code 
    below.
</p>
<pre>
    // React imports
    import React, { createContext, useReducer, useContext, useEffect } from "react";
    
    // Firebase imports
    import firebase from "../firebase";
    
    // My imports
    import { SessionReducer } from "../reducers/SessionReducer";
    
    // initial state values
    const initialState = {
      name: null,
      email: null,
      photourl: null,
      emailVerified: false,
      uid: null
    };
    
    // create the context
    export const SessionContext = createContext();
    
    // create the context provider
    const SessionContextProvider = props => {
      const [session, dispatch] = useReducer(SessionReducer, initialState);
      return (
        <SessionContext.Provider value={{ session, dispatch }}>
          {props.children}
        </SessionContext.Provider>
      );
    };
    
    // create the custom hook
    export const useSession = () => {
      const contextState = useContext(SessionContext);
      const { dispatch } = contextState;
      useEffect(() => {
        firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(user => {
          var currentUser = {};
          if (user) {
            currentUser = {
              name: user.displayName,
              email: user.email,
              photourl: user.photoURL,
              emailVerified: user.emailVerified,
              uid: user.uid
            };
          } else {
            currentUser = initialState;
          }
          dispatch({
            type: "UPDATE",
            session: currentUser
          });
        });
      }, [dispatch]);
      return contextState;
    };
    
    export default SessionContextProvider;    
</pre>
<p>
    Notice near the top of the code I have included an import of the Reducer described earlier. I have not 
    described the struction of my appliation but suffice to say that my Contexts and Reducers each 
    reside in folders made for that purpose. You can organize your source files any way you like.
</p>
<p>
    Following the imports, I create and export the SessionContext using React's API for that purpose. It's 
    one line of code that requires no parameters. Next I have a few lines of code to create the "Context 
    Provider". This is a small amount of code that includes JSX that ties the context to components in 
    the application. React includes to methods for this: <i>Provider</i> and <i>Consumer</i>, but since I
    am using functional components exclusively I must use the Provider method.
</p>
<p>
    The Provider binds the Reducer to the Context. In this code I use the <i>useReducer</i> function to 
    deconstruct its' return value into the "session" and the "dispatch". The session is the current 
    state and the dispatch is the function I supplied when I wrote the Reducer. These values are passed as 
    props (via HTML attributes) to the provider context. The <i>{props.children}</i> value assures that this 
    context provider will be available to all children components to the component where it is used. 
    That should be clear later. I should also mention that the provider context is just another component. 
    In my case, the context provider is my default exported function.
</p>
<h2>The Custom Hook</h2>
<p>
    The last function creates the custom hook. By convention the names of hooks start with "use" in lower
    case; i.e. useContext, useReducer, or in my case useSession. The custom hook first retrieves data from
    this context, which is the state and the dispatch function, and stores it in <i>contextState</i>. The 
    dispatch function is deconstructed out of the contextState. For my purpose here, I will not need the 
    actual values of the state.
</p>
<p>
    The work of this custom hook is accomplished within a useEffect function. If youâ€™re familiar with React 
    class lifecycle methods, you can think of useEffect Hook as <i>componentDidMount</i>, <i>componentDidUpdate</i>
    , and <i>componentWillUnmount</i> combined. In this case, whenever a component that uses our hook is 
    rendered, a call is made to the Firebase <i>onAuthStateChanged</i> method. That method is passed a function 
    that checks the state of the current Firebase user. If the user exists then the Firebase used is passed 
    to the dispatch function, otherwise the initial state of the user (which is null) is passed to dispatch.
</p>
<h2>Wiring it up</h2>
<p>
    The rest is simply writing the custom hook into the app. In this case I wanted to make the hook available 
    to the entire application. To accopmlish this I added my context provider to the <i>app.js</i> main code 
    file.

<p>
    In this file there are just a couple of lines needed. First is the import of the SessionContextProvider. 
    And the others are the JSX SessionContextProvider tags.
</p>
<p>
    To signup a new user bind the function below to your form submission handler.
</p>
<pre>
...
import { signup } from "../../services/firebaseAuth";
...
// form actions
const handleSubmit = e => {
  e.preventDefault();
  enroll();
};

// firebase signup function
const enroll = () => {
  const results = validate(
    {
      email: email,
      password: password,
      firstName: firstName,
      lastName: lastName,
      confirmedPwd: confirmedPwd
    },
    {
      email: constraints.email,
      password: constraints.password,
      firstName: constraints.firstName,
      lastName: constraints.lastName,
      confirmedPwd: constraints.confirmedPwd
    }
  );

  if (results) {
    setErrors(results);
  } else {
    setErrors(null);
    signup(email, password);
  }
};
</pre>
<p>
    A couple of points about the code above. First, the <i>validate</i> function it its' <i>constraints</i> 
    are out of the scope of this article. If anyone reads this, and someone asks about <i>validate</i> then 
    I will consider writing another post to describe that function. And second, there is a helper function 
    <i>signup</i> that I show a bit later.
</p>
<p>
    Signing in is similar.
</p>
<pre>
...
import { SessionContext, useSession } from "../../contexts/SessionContext";
import { signin } from "../../services/firebaseAuth";
    
const SignIn = () => {
const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
const [errors, setErrors] = useState();
const { session } = useSession(SessionContext);
const handleSubmit = e => {
  e.preventDefault();
  authenticate();
};

// firebase signin function
const authenticate = () => {
const results = validate(
    {
      email: email,
      password: password
    },
    {
      email: constraints.email,
      password: constraints.password
    }
  );
 
  if (results) {
    setErrors(results);
  } else {
    setErrors(null);
    signin(email, password);
  }
};
...
</pre>
<p>
    Again, the <i>signin</i> function is shown later. And lastly I sign out with a link button on 
    my AppBar that executes the <i>signout</i> fuction (and yes, the function must be imported).
</p>
<pre>
    <Button color="inherit" component={Link} to="/" onClick={signout}>
        Sign Out
    </Button>
</pre>
<p>
    The final piece of the puzzle are the supporting functions that call out to Firebase. These are the 
    <i>signup</i>, <i>signin</i>, and <i>signout</i> functions mentioned above. I organized the functions 
    into a single source code file. For purposes of this paper, these functions were copied directly 
    from the Firebase documentation website and do not incude any of my application specific code. I 
    created the file <i>firebaseAuth.js</i> for this. The code is below.
</p>
<pre>
    // Firebase imports
    import firebase from "../firebase";
    
    export const signup = (email, password) => {
      firebase
        .auth()
        .createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
        .catch(error => {
          // Handle Errors here.
          alert("Error during sign up " + error.message); // delete this!
          var errorCode = error.code;
          var errorMessage = error.message;
          if (errorCode === "auth/weak-password") {
            alert("The password is too weak.");
          } else {
            alert(errorMessage);
          }
          console.log(error);
        });
    };
    
    export const signin = (email, password) => {
      firebase
        .auth()
        .signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
        .catch(function(error) {
          // Handle Errors here.
          var errorCode = error.code;
          var errorMessage = error.message;
          if (errorCode === "auth/wrong-password") {
            alert("Wrong password.");
          } else {
            alert(errorMessage);
          }
          console.log(error);
        });
    };
    
    export const signout = () => {
      firebase
        .auth()
        .signOut()
        .then(function() {
          // Sign-out successful.
        })
        .catch(function(error) {
          console.log(error);
        });
    };
</pre>
<p>
    So the next person who need to implement Firebase Authentication with React Hooks now has 
    some reference material to start with. Questions and comments are welcome.
